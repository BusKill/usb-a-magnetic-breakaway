#  What's New?

Made some progress with making the code more usable. Fine tuning the lid, base, and midpieces. Planning to resize to accomodate a larger screw and pillar nut than previous designs. Position of release is now at hip instead of at the port, so we can work with more forgiving dimensions.

Will start tracking releases by each iteration that may be printable.
