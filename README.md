Design requirements for an open-source USB-A magnetic breakaway connector used in the BusKill laptop kill cord 

If you create your own version, please create a folder and add your assets to the folder. Feel free to document your section content in this Readme following the style by which I have documented mine.

## Goldfishlaser Version

###  What's New?

I have started over from scratch to use disc magnets and also to go back to a two piece instead of three piece design. However, my three piece design with the hex magnets is also still available. Publicised here: https://www.buskill.in/3d-print-2023-04/

My version is built in OpenSCAD and is still a work in progress. Currently trying to suss out exactly what the wiring requirements are to get the cord to successfully transmit data through the connection after splicing.
