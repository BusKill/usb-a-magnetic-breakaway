# usb-a-magnetic-breakaway

This repo is for documenting and providing the design requirements for an open-source USB-A magnetic breakaway connector used in the BusKill laptop kill cord. This project is a Work In Progress and it welcomes contributors. 

Please see https://github.com/BusKill/usb-a-magnetic-breakaway/issues/2 for a history of the development so far and the latest news on what people are currently working on with regard to the 3D printed version of the case.

## goldfishlaser 3D-Printed Version

My version is built in OpenSCAD and is still a work in progress. Currently trying to suss out exactly what the wiring requirements are to get the cord to successfully transmit data through the connection after splicing.

###  What's New?

I have started over from scratch to use disc magnets and also to go back to a two piece instead of three piece design. However, my three piece design with the hex magnets is also still available. Publicised here: https://www.buskill.in/3d-print-2023-04/
