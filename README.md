# usb-a-magnetic-breakaway

This repo is for documenting and providing the design requirements for an open-source USB-A magnetic breakaway connector used in the BusKill laptop kill cord. This project is a Work In Progress and it welcomes contributors. 

Please see https://github.com/BusKill/usb-a-magnetic-breakaway/issues/2 for a history of the development so far and the latest news on what people are currently working on with regard to the 3D printed version of the case.

##  What's New?

* Updates to goldfishlaser Version: Goldfishlaser has started over from scratch to use disc magnets and also to go back to a two piece instead of three piece design. However, the three piece design with the hex magnets is also still available. Publicised here: https://www.buskill.in/3d-print-2023-04/

* New FreeCAD version: Leoheck has started working on a version of the case in FreeCAD. This version uses Yoosoo spring pressure pogo pins,uses aluminium can for pin contacts, and has pressfit voids for cube magnets. This version contains a female USB port.
